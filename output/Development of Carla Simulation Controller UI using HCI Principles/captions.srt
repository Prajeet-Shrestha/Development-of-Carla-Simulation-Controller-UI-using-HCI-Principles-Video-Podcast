00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
Prajeet: Hello everyone,  this is Prajeet Shrestha
back with another video where we will

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,000
discuss a research project that we were
quite working on for a while now

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,280
now this is something that was really
important for us not because it was a

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,880
semester assessment but it was something
that we really wanted to work on

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,960
and be able to produce a significant
the result I have my team members with me to

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,640
discuss about the project and just to
touch on everything that we did

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,640
however if you want to learn more about
the project in detail you can email me

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,000
to get the research paper which will be
released after first of December
Saahil: Thank you so much for inviting us

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,920
Prajeet: Welcome everyone now talking
about the project like i said it is a

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,600
research-based project for developing a
user interface from the perspective of

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,320
HCI for a self-driving car simulator
now carla is an open source simulator

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,079
where you can Simulate and research on
self-driving cars in this space i would

13
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,920
like to create an opportunity for us to
discuss the journey that we do before we

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,559
discuss anything
let's just understand some of the

15
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,320
objectives of the project from Aayush,
Aayush: Thank you so much Prajeet for the lovely

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,239
introduction of the project I'm Aayush Kafle
I'm here to talk about the Objectives

17
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,520
that we're trying to reach while creating
this interface design

18
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,280
before that i would like to explain why
we created this ui design in the first

19
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,760
place
now in our system to do the simple

20
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,320
things inside of simulation
we need to manually call the function

21
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,080
like when we record a simulation or
start it it's more like cui

22
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,520
so we decided to create a smart UI to
make our task easier

23
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,640
in terms of adding or changing things
and simulation so that

24
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,119
programmer can focus on the actual part of the
research now the objectives we tried to

25
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,880
reach while creating this interface was
to create a control panel or system ui

26
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,079
for better Usability 
To create a consistent UI that followed

27
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,439
most of the UI principles
and to cater to the universality of the

28
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,399
user's product
and finally we try to justify the

29
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,640
objectives and statements with the
survey

30
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,079
where we found that 75 percent of people
in this relevant research

31
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,479
work yeah so keeping those in mind
during the second week

32
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,759
we created a case document and had an
open discussion with some of our

33
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,240
colleague team
where we found the pros and cons of the

34
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,880
project and improvised and
pre-documented it

35
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,920
which was a huge milestone for us in
terms of improvement

36
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,600
and once we had a proper idea and
supporting document on our third week

37
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,680
we started working on creating a paper
prototype the model that you see here

38
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,520
was the final prototype that we created
with a lot of suggestions and feedback

39
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,760
from people about what they liked and
disliked

40
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,200
you can find more about the prototype in
our resource paper

41
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,120
as we moved on to the next week what we
had to do was to create a ui that users

42
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,640
can interact with
so we created a front-end interface with

43
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,200
javascript and html
css it took us almost a week to finalize

44
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,080
the interface
but once we completed it it was

45
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,200
something we really liked
and loved the design of the interface

46
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,560
the ui that you are looking at
is what we developed after working on it

47
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,879
for a week and we're quite happy about
it

48
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,800
as we progressed on to the next phase of
our research we invited a few of our

49
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,120
colleagues to evaluate and concern the
design

50
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,239
and identify as many potential usability
problems

51
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,159
as possible now this space was really
crucial for us because

52
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,599
it would give us an external perspective
and opportunity for improvement

53
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,879
heuristic evaluation was done based on
jacob's nielsen

54
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,360
10 usability heuristics for finding any
design issues associated with the user

55
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,640
interface
so finally what we needed to find was

56
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,360
how users with different background and
knowledge would

57
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,599
observe and react to our ui so we
created a user persona of other type of

58
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,640
users that might use a product some of
them were like

59
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,400
a fourth-year student researching on
self-driving car in different weathers

60
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,120
or a graduate student trying to record
and analyze the algorithm we conducted

61
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,440
those kinds of ethnographic  resource for
those users who understand how a certain

62
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,599
group of customers would interact and
observe the ui for any case we also

63
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,720
produce a detailed summarization of each
principles

64
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,720
used and evaluated the UI based on
Schneidermanâ€™s 8 Golden Rules 

65
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,400
as well as Norman's 7 principles for better
understanding of the product and

66
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,680
improvising it
and now what we needed to do was to see

67
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,439
how user-friendly the UI is so we
conducted some of the online phone

68
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,040
usability testing
in google meet to let some user actually

69
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,319
experience the
ui and give us some feedbacks and we

70
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,519
reported the whole
interview and produced some conclusion

71
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,879
like the heat map that you can see here
and that's how we completed and

72
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,480
concluded the research project. I would
like to thank you Mr.Sushil Shrestha for

73
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,079
giving us this opportunity and the whole
team for everything that they did thank

74
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,280
you stay safe bye
